* What is IAM Role?
  - You can assign a Role to EC2 or User or Mobile Application to access resources 
  - Role does NOT have a statndard long term credentials. (such as user name and password or access key)
  - However, when you assign a Role to a user a **Temporary Security Credential** will assign to user to provide more secure granular access
  - NOTE: When a user assumes a role, **temporary security credentials** are created dynamically and provided to the user - making it a more secure to grant access.

* Who can use the role? 
  - You can delegate access to:
    - Users
    - Applications
    - Services 
    - That doesn't have access to AWS resources
