### CloudFront

* What is it? 
  - Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers:
    - data, 
    - videos, 
    - applications, 
    - and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.
    
* CloudFront is integrated with (AWS-edge locations) AWS – both physical locations that are directly connected to the AWS global infrastructure, 
  as well as other AWS service
  
 
 * CloudFront works seamlessly with services:
    - including AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation, 
    - Amazon S3, 
    - Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon EC2 as origins for your applications, 
    - Lambda@Edge to run custom code closer to customers’ users and to customize the user experience
    
  * If you use AWS origins such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing, 
    you don’t pay for any data transferred between these services and CloudFront.
    
  * The Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) is massively scaled and **globally distributed**
  
  * Amazon CloudFront Origin Domains:
    - Amazon S3 bucket
    - Web Server (Elastic Load Balancers)
    - AWS Media Package endpoint
    - AWS MediaStoreContainer endpoint
